		<span style="font-size:60%">Apologies, there's a bug on this progress bar which sometimes resets it to 0 after a while. This does not affect existing donations - it's a database problem. I believe I may have solved that problem but in case it recurs, <a href="https://dataclips.heroku.com/zyjtwohnrtoamadooruhwtjbnpip-users-and-donors">you can check the amount raised with this Heroku Dataclip</a>. It returns the amount in cents.<BR>Of course, If everything I wrote worked perfectly the first time, of course, there would be no need for code camp. --Brian</span></div>
