## What information do you collect?

We collect your e-mail address as a unique identifier, and the amount you donated, in a database for the purpose of determining the number of donors and the amount we’ve raised so far. We do not use your e-mail address to send you e-mail, other than perhaps, a thank-you note. We will never sell, rent, share or distribute that information to anyone.

We use analytics information to improve the site, and we will sometimes share usage information with reporters, funders and others. But we only share that information at an aggregate level; we never share information about individual users.

Changes to this policy will be noted on this page and in the blog. 

Policy effective date: June 27, 2015

## Is my credit card secure?

Your credit card information never touches our servers - it goes directly to Stripe. [Here is Stripe’s security information](https://stripe.com/help/security).
