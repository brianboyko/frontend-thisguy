## SendThisGuyToCodeCamp.com

#### **Goal:** Create complete crowdfunding site with payment processing and progress tracking.

#### *Technologies used: Heroku, Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, Sass, Jekyll, Javascript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, Stripe*

---

![Project-Thisguy](images/project_thisguy.png)

First, there's the look and feel of the site itself, which was hand-coded in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html).  It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which allows me to focus on content without having to repeat HTML code constantly, and automatically translates [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) into HTML. Originally, this was hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) during development, but eventually the site's front end was moved to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) in order to enable SSL, through [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). 

While it would have been much simpler to use an existing crowdfunding infrastructure, such as GoFundMe.com, the ~5% markup they charge meant that it was worth it to build my own infrastructure instead. To do this, I use [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to handle credit card payments, [adapting from this code](https://github.com/thoughtpolice/heroku-stripe-donate) from Github user "Thoughtpolice". The original code only allowed for a single text-entry field for donations, which would have been cumbersome on mobile, so I added buttons for different amounts, which use [Javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/js/) to pre-populate that field. (I thought about enabling one-button donation, but I feel that users should be able to visually verify the amount they donate before pressing the checkout button.) 

The solution Stripe uses allows me to collect credit card payments without collecting credit card data. Your credit card information goes directly to Stripe and is not stored anywhere on our servers.  

One feature that was quite a puzzler was getting the progress bar working correctly. In order to do this, I would have to store the amount and number of users somewhere - eventually, I ran a [PostgreSQL database](http://www.postgresql.org/) on the same server as the backend payment processing. There I store *only* e-mail addresses and amounts, by including the [PG ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/pg/versions/0.18.2) into ThoughtPolice's code, and making a query into the database which stores a new line of data. 

Additionally, each time the amount changes (i.e., whenever a payment is processed) the site also generates a [.json file](http://json.org/) that the back-end server serves via [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), The front-end then takes that data via a [Javascript XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) to get the correct amount for the progress bar. 

While it might have been possible to grab the data directly from the database, using JSON in this way limits the amount of information the front end can access from the database, and makes that access read-only, keeping the two servers seperated. 

The rest was just HTML and CSS, such as the floating social media icons you see in the upper right hand corner - for that I just used the pregenerated CSS animations on the [Hover.css project](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/). 

* Serve a good looking (or good-enough looking) front-end for a "crowdfunding site"
* Integrate with Stripe and take payments
* Save (only) e-mail addresses and amount raised in a PostgreSQL database
* Generate a JSON file which can be read by the site to create an up-to-the-second accurate progress bar.
* Add features for additional pages and blogs
* Code with the Jekyll HTML preprocessor, CSS, and Sass.

## [unPromoTed](http://sendthisguytocodecamp.com/imgur/javascript/2015/06/29/unPromoTed.html)

#### **Goal:** Write program to block "promoted" content on Imgur through a Chrome extension

#### *Technologies used: Javascript, Chrome*

Jun 29, 2015 • Brian Boyko

Imgur's promoted content annoys a few users, and I thought it would be really easy to check to see if a post was a “promoted post” and if so, replace the content of the post with a short message.

It was tricky, but I was able to get it done. You can [download it/fork it on Github](https://github.com/brianboyko/unPromoTed).

## Shuffler

#### **Goal:** Create web-based poker probabilities calculator

#### *Technologies used: Javascript*

---

![Shuffler](images/shuffler.png)

This is my first programming project since starting on my path as developer, and one which is primarily "programming-focused" rather than "web focused." It is incomplete, and in-progress. 

The goal is to eventually replicate as a web-based application the functionality of PokerStove, an app for Windows that can tell you the probability of your hand against your opponent's multiple possible holdings. 

As it currently stands, it is feature incomplete, although I have learned quite a bit about object-oriented programming and the capabilities of vanilla Javascript in the browser.  Currently, it can:

* Create a deck - an array of 52 "card" objects with properties of "rank" and "suit"
* Shuffle that deck into a (pseudo)random order. 
* Parse individual cards by name.
* Grab a five card poker hand. 
* Take a string input and convert that into a poker hand.
* Evaluate the ranking of a poker hand. 
* Compare two hands and see what beats what. 
* Find the best possible 5 card poker hand out of a seven-card spread.
* Compare two holdem hands, deal a random board, and determine a winner. 

Naturally, I have a long way to go and I put it on hold for other things, but eventually, I hope to have the program feature complete.  I'm also not sure my algorithm is efficient enough to run solely in client-side Javascript code, as evaluating the probabilities of one hand against each other exactly would require generating (47!-42!), or 2.58 x 10<sup>59</sup> permutations of cards. Instead, I'm considering using [Monte Carlo simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) instead, with a sample size of 100,000 to start.  Even then that may tax the browser so the whole thing might have to be rewritten to take advantage of Node.JS or even built as a C++ program that generates an output that can be read by the front-end using Javascript.  

You can view the code at [Github](https://github.com/brianboyko/shuffler).

## Mayone.US/Mayday.US

#### **Goal:** Raise $6M. 

#### *Technologies used: Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, Jekyll, Javascript, WordPress, Google App Engine, Stripe*

---

![Mayday PAC](images/mayday.png)

More details of this story can be found on the [About Page](../about.html), but the first version of this site was built on [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), and used Stripe for payment processing. 

Eventually, with a team of more experienced developers at the helm, the site was moved to a GitHub Pages based front-end and a [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) backend for payments. Wordpress was ditched for static sites using Jekyll to solve the load problem we had from day one.
